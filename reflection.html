I worked the assignment different times/days and some of </br>
my pages didn't work together. I had to create new files, </br>
 copy my old ones to the new files I created and work it that way.
</br>

I also had a hard time adding the images. I tried to put</br>
 them in the same directory and called them but it didn't </br>
 still work. I don't know exactly what I changed but it </br>
 worked for me. </br>

I had a hard time connectin the css to my html pages. </br>

Other than how time consuming it was, I learned a lot </br> 
 while I was doing this assignment. It was frustrating </br>
  at times but seeing it to fruition was very satisfying.
